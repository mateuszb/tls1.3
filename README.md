# Overview

TLS 1.3 is a minimal common lisp implementation of the TLS1.3 specification that doesn't require
too many external dependencies and uses sane defaults from the TLS1.3 RFC. It does not try to be complete
implementation but rather a compact one. The scope of this project is limited due to the ever expanding
complexity of TLS1.3 extensions and possibilities.
